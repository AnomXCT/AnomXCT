ğŸ”°Hi visitors to my github address, 
  I hope you are doing well today.

ğŸ”°I do hacking as I please, 
  without any coercion. 
  And I do it in my own way.

ğŸ”°Believe that vulnerability 
  is not the fault of the system, 
  it's who is doing it.

ğŸ”°And my hacking medium is termux, 
  because it's easy for me 
  and for everyone.
